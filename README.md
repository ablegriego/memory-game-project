## Project Background

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Google Scholarship (Phase 2, Project 3).
Code was pulled from a Udacity repository and amended in line with the project rubric. The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. Some modifications were made to the HTNL and CSS files but the predominant assessment was of Javascript skills. 

The coding is all Vanilla JS and manipulates the DOM to provide the functionality.

## Instructions

Load code. Click on the cards and match the pairs. Once you have revealed a pair if they match they stay facing, if unmatched the cards flip back. Can you remember where the cards are and match them up? See how fast you can find the eight pairs and beat your time.
